## About the game

<blockquote>
<div><p>Pokémon Crystal Legacy is an enhancement hack that aims to improve Generation 2’s most underdeveloped areas, whiling holding on to the mechanics and feel that made it unique. Rather than bring modern Pokémon design philosophy to Crystal, Legacy only makes changes based off precedents set in the game’s original design. This ensures an authentic gen 2 experience, while bringing the game to it’s full potential.
</p>
<p>Features Include
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Gym Leader level scaling for ‘non linear’ part of Johto. The team’s and levels of Chuck, Pryce and Jasmine scale to whether you have 5, 6, or 7 badges.
</li>
<li>Gym Leader teams optimized. Leaders see more Gen 2 representation, while still retaining their original aces (e.g. Bugsy keeps his Scyther, but Metapod and Kakuna are replaced with Pineco and Ledian). Movepools see increasing diversity and complexity. Gym Leaders use held items.
</li>
<li>Improved level curve. Gym leaders and trainers no longer fall off in the late mid-game, only to spike in the Elite Fuur. The game now sees a more linear rise in leveling, with expanding trainer teams to provide more EXP. Players who don’t grind will still be under leveled to the champion, but this is intentional and typical for most Pokémon games.
</li>
<li>Pokémon availability increased. Kanto locked Gen 2 mons like Houndour added to Johto. Route encounters have been diversified. Gen 1 trade mons evolve by level up. Gen 2 trade items now simply work like evolution stones. Increased accessibility to evo items. Fossils + GS Ball added to Ruins of Alph. All legendaries are now catchable.
</li>
<li>Gameplay Balancing. Dark-type is now Physical while Ghost is Special. DRASTIC improvements to Pokémon movepools. Balancing to actual moves (notably large improvements to bug and fighting type). Weak single evo mons + other underperformers have seen some stat buffs (i.e Misdrievus is now closer stat wise to Mismagius, but not on par).
</li>
<li>Item Improvements. Flower shop now sells Berries. Cianwood pharmacy sells Stones &amp; Ethers. Post radio tower Mahogany mart sells Upgrade and Metal Coat. Mahogany, Blackthorn, and Celadon now sell TMs. X Items cannot be purchased.
</li>
<li>Storyline enhancements. Slight adjustments to timing of Silver’s character arc. A man helps Lance uncover the Rocket Hideout. Team Rocket has seen Executives named as Archer and Ariana. ‘Hyuck-Hyuck’ Rocket now has a small character arc. The game now has an explanation for the missing Legendaries of Kanto.
</li>
<li>Quality of Life: Unique Pokémon Sprites, Running Shoes, Bigger Bag, Early EXP Share, Delete HMs whenever, TM pickup now says move name, PC added to Elm’s Lab and House after Tohjo Falls, Gameplay Icon that shows Weather, Bugs Fixed, Brick Piece (found in Goldenrod Warehouse) now evolves Hitmontop, Odd Egg always has good DVs, Happiness System makes Friendship Evos faster, Third Trainer Card show Kanto Badges, bugs fixed AND MORE.
</li>
<li>Rematch Johto Gym Leaders after becoming Johto Champion.
</li>
<li>Kanto is now it’s own separate league. Gym leader teams have competitively set teams of 6. Upon beating them, you must rematch the Elite Four for title of Kanto Champion before facing Red. Consider this section a ‘challenge’ post game.
</li>
<li>Fight the creator (Smith), production manager (Craig) and video editor (Weebra) in the Trainer House.
</li>
</ul>
<p>What Stays the Same
</p>
<ul>
<li>No Physical/Special split
</li>
<li>All Pokémon keep their typing
</li>
<li>No new Pokémon added
</li>
<li>No new trainers added
</li>
<li>Badge boost remains
</li>
<li>Trainer AI is untouched
</li>
<li>TMs are single use (all TMs eventually become available for purchase)
</li>
<li>Most original wild encounters remain where they were, outside of some overly redundant ones
</li>
<li>All storyline outcomes are the same, although some get to their conclusion slightly differently</li>
</ul>

Pokémon Crystal Legacy is a meticulously crafted ROM hack of the beloved Pokémon Crystal game from the second generation of Pokémon titles. This enhancement project strives to address and improve upon the areas of the original game that were underdeveloped, without compromising the nostalgic mechanics and unique feel that defined Generation 2. Rather than integrating modern Pokémon design philosophies, Crystal Legacy builds on the foundations set by the original game, ensuring an authentic experience that elevates the classic to its full potential.

One of the standout features of Pokémon Crystal Legacy is the dynamic level scaling of Gym Leaders during the non-linear section of Johto. Gym Leaders such as Chuck, Pryce, and Jasmine have their teams and levels adjusted based on whether the player has 5, 6, or 7 badges, ensuring a balanced and challenging progression regardless of the order in which they are faced. Additionally, gym leader teams have been optimized to feature more Generation 2 Pokémon while retaining their iconic ace Pokémon. For example, Bugsy keeps his Scyther, but his team is bolstered with stronger Pokémon like Pineco and Ledian. This rebalancing extends to movepools and held items, adding depth and strategic complexity to gym battles.

The game's level curve has also been carefully revised. In the original Crystal, there was a noticeable drop in difficulty during the late mid-game, followed by a sudden spike at the Elite Four. Crystal Legacy introduces a more gradual and consistent leveling experience, with trainers’ teams expanding to provide ample experience points. This means players who don’t engage in excessive grinding will still find themselves underleveled against the Champion, maintaining the challenge typical of Pokémon games.

Pokémon availability has seen significant improvements. Previously Kanto-exclusive Generation 2 Pokémon like Houndour are now accessible in Johto, and route encounters have been diversified to enhance the overall variety of wild Pokémon. Trade-evolution Pokémon can now evolve via level-up, and items required for evolutions are more readily available. Notably, fossils and the GS Ball have been added to the Ruins of Alph, and all legendary Pokémon are now catchable, offering players a more complete and fulfilling gameplay experience.

Gameplay balancing has been addressed through several key adjustments. For instance, the Dark-type is now physical while Ghost-type moves are special, reflecting a more logical distribution of move types. Many Pokémon have received drastic improvements to their movepools, and weaker single-evolution Pokémon have had their stats buffed to make them more viable in battle. Additionally, numerous moves have been rebalanced, with significant enhancements to Bug and Fighting-type moves.

Item improvements further enhance the gameplay. The Flower Shop now sells Berries, the Cianwood Pharmacy offers Stones and Ethers, and the Mahogany Mart, after the Rocket incident, sells rare items like Upgrade and Metal Coat. Several marts now offer TMs for sale, but X Items have been removed from purchase lists to maintain balance.

The storyline of Pokémon Crystal has received subtle yet impactful enhancements. Adjustments to Silver’s character arc provide a richer narrative experience, and new minor characters add depth to Team Rocket’s schemes. The inclusion of named Rocket Executives, Archer and Ariana, along with a more fleshed-out "Hyuck-Hyuck" Rocket, contribute to a more engaging plot. The game also explains the absence of Kanto’s legendary Pokémon, adding coherence to the world’s lore.

Quality of life improvements are abundant in Pokémon Crystal Legacy. Players can enjoy features like unique Pokémon sprites, running shoes, a bigger bag, and early access to EXP Share. HMs can be deleted at any time, and TMs now display their move names upon pickup. Elm’s Lab and house gain PC access post-Tohjo Falls, and various gameplay icons, such as weather indicators, enhance the user interface. Bugs from the original game have been fixed, and numerous enhancements like the Happiness System speeding up friendship evolutions contribute to a smoother and more enjoyable gaming experience.

After becoming the Johto Champion, players can rematch Johto Gym Leaders and face a completely revamped Kanto, which is now its own league. Kanto’s Gym Leaders have competitively designed teams of six Pokémon, and players must defeat them before rematching the Elite Four for the title of Kanto Champion. This challenging post-game content culminates in a final showdown against Red.

Additionally, players can battle the game’s creators—Smith, Craig, and Weebra—in the Trainer House, adding a unique and personal touch to the endgame content.

By refining and expanding upon the beloved features of Pokémon Crystal, Pokémon Crystal Legacy offers both nostalgic and new players an enriched journey through Johto and Kanto, making it a must-play for any Pokémon fan.
