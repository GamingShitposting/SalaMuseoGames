<b><span style="font-size: 22px"> :t276: Story</span></b><br/>
<div style="margin-left: 20px">21 years ago, Pokemon lived in harmony in the woods. The Pokemons there were ruled by the Pokemon Trevenant.<br/>
<br/>
One day, A group of people came and started cutting trees and building houses. There was no left home for the Pokemons. The Trevenant did not know what to do so it ask help on the Harvest Goddess. Harvest Goddess quickly responds and tried to punish the people. But she fell in love with one of them, and his name was Eric, which also fell in love with her. So Harvest Goddess forgave Eric and his townspeople. Trevenant didn&#039;t like her decision but he doesn&#039;t have any choice until he learned that If Harvest Goddess marries a human, she will lost all of her powers and pass it to Trevenant that&#039;s one thing Harvest Goddess didn&#039;t know about herself.<br/>
<br/>
Until 2 years later they got married (That&#039;s a long wait, huh?). At the end of the wedding, Harvest Goddess tried to use her powers to create fireworks but it didn&#039;t work, that&#039;s the time when she realized she lost all of her powers but she accepted it because she is happy with her husband.<br/>
<br/>
Trevenant is wondering why he still don&#039;t have Harvest Goddess&#039; powers so he asked Kappa, Harvest Goddess&#039; brother. Kappa said that he will only obtain Harvest Goddess&#039; powers at the birth of the Harvest Baby.(Kappa didn&#039;t know about Trevenant&#039;s plan yet). One day, Kappa manage to find out Trevenant&#039;s plan, to trap the people inside the town and to kill the Harvest Baby so he tried to stop him but he failed. Kappa was trap inside a mine. Kappa told Trevenant that someone can stop him.<br/>
<br/>
A year later the Harvest Baby is born at that time Trevenant has obtained Harvest Goddess&#039; powers and started the attack. He traps the people inside the town with cursed trees. Harvest Goddess&#039; and ERIC tried to escape they put the baby in the basket. Eric and the baby escaped but Harvest Goddess&#039; didn&#039;t get lucky, she got trap inside the town with the other people. Eric got away from the town with the baby. Knowing Trevenant is after the baby, he left the baby in front of a fosters house. (Why?!? Isn&#039;t he safer with you!?!?)<br/>
<br/>
You&#039;re an 21 year old who&#039;s just starting out on your journey but suddenly you got trapped in the town by Trevenant just for fun. Did he made a very bad thing to trap you in the town too? Can you stop this nonsense and free the townspeople?&#8203;</div><br/>

"Pokemon HarvestCraft" is an innovative rom hack of "Pokemon Ruby" developed by quil09. This game combines the beloved elements of traditional Pokemon gameplay with the immersive mechanics of farming, ranching, and crafting, creating a uniquely engaging experience for players.

The story begins 21 years prior when Pokemon lived peacefully in the woods under the rule of the Pokemon Trevenant. This tranquility was disrupted when humans arrived, cut down trees, and built a town, leaving the Pokemon homeless. In response, Trevenant sought help from the Harvest Goddess. However, complications arose when the Harvest Goddess fell in love with Eric, one of the humans, and chose to forgive them. Unbeknownst to her, if she married a human, she would lose all her powers, which would then pass to Trevenant.

Two years later, the Harvest Goddess and Eric married. At the ceremony's conclusion, the Harvest Goddess realized she had lost her powers but accepted this for the sake of her happiness with Eric. Trevenant, puzzled by his lack of new powers, consulted Kappa, the Harvest Goddess's brother, and learned that the powers would transfer to him upon the birth of the Harvest Baby. When Kappa discovered Trevenant's malevolent plan to trap the townspeople and kill the Harvest Baby, he attempted to intervene but was imprisoned in a mine by Trevenant.

A year later, the Harvest Baby was born, and Trevenant gained the Harvest Goddess's powers. He trapped the townspeople with cursed trees. The Harvest Goddess and Eric tried to escape with their child, but only Eric and the baby managed to flee, leaving the Harvest Goddess trapped. Eric, knowing Trevenant's pursuit, left the baby at a foster home for safety.

Players step into the role of a 21-year-old starting their journey, only to be trapped in the cursed town by Trevenant. The main quest revolves around stopping Trevenant and freeing the townspeople.

"Pokemon HarvestCraft" introduces numerous unique features that distinguish it from the original "Pokemon Ruby." The game includes a weather system where seasonal changes impact gameplay; for instance, rain and snow affect energy expenditure during work. Time progresses with map transitions, influencing NPC movements and interactions. Seasons change every 30 days, altering available items and wild Pokemon encounters.

Farming and ranching are core mechanics. Players can plant Apricorns (except in winter) and manage Pokemon like Torchics, Skiddos, and Gogoats. A new berry system ensures daily regrowth of berries. Instead of traditional Gym Leaders and Elite Four, players earn badges by defeating shop owners, with Trevenant serving as the final challenge.

The game also features a crafting system, enabling players to create tools and cook food to replenish energy and health. New items, including foods and apricorns, enrich the gameplay. Energy mechanics add a layer of strategy, as energy depletes with work and can be replenished through eating or sleeping, with maximum energy determined by the number of badges earned.

Romance options are available with bachelors and bachelorettes, adding a love system to the game. Additionally, Fairy Type Pokemon and moves are included, alongside new moves tailored with suitable animations.

Overall, "Pokemon HarvestCraft" offers a rich and varied gameplay experience that melds the charm of traditional Pokemon adventures with the depth of simulation elements, providing players with numerous features and surprises to discover.
