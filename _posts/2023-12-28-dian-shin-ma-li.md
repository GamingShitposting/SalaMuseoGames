## About the game

Fortran, colloquially known as "Dian Shin Ma Li," stands as a remarkable testament to the subversive world of bootleg NES games. Emerging from the shadows of the gaming industry, Fortran defies the conventions of traditional Nintendo Entertainment System titles, thrusting players into a clandestine realm of gambling excitement and pixelated unpredictability.

The subtitle "Dian Shin Ma Li" adds an air of mystery to the game, further emphasizing its illicit origins and the intriguing journey it promises players. The name itself, a fusion of different languages, reflects the multicultural influences embedded in the game's design, contributing to its enigmatic allure.

At its core, Fortran is a gambling game that pushes the boundaries of what players expect from the NES platform. The pixelated graphics, reminiscent of the 8-bit era, create a nostalgic ambiance, transporting players back to a time when gaming was in its infancy. However, the familiarity ends there, as Fortran introduces a gambling dynamic rarely seen on the NES.

In this bootleg masterpiece, players find themselves immersed in a variety of casino-style games, from slot machines to poker, all rendered in charmingly primitive graphics. The unpredictability of each round keeps players on the edge, creating an addictive gaming experience that defies the limitations of the NES hardware.

What sets Fortran apart is its underground status, existing on the fringes of the gaming world. Produced by rogue developers operating in the shadows, the game evaded the watchful eyes of official Nintendo certification, making it a rare find for collectors and enthusiasts alike. The scarcity of Fortran cartridges contributes to its mystique, with each copy becoming a coveted artifact for those seeking a taste of the forbidden in the gaming universe.

The gameplay mechanics of Fortran are deceptively simple, yet the stakes are high. The bootleg nature of the game allows for unconventional twists and turns, with unexpected events and challenges keeping players guessing at every turn. It's a gamble within a gamble, and the thrill lies in navigating the unpredictable landscape that Fortran unfolds.

Despite its unorthodox origins, Fortran boasts a dedicated fan base drawn to its rebellious spirit and uncharted gaming territory. The game has become a symbol of the creativity that emerges when developers operate outside the bounds of official channels, pushing the boundaries of what is deemed acceptable in the gaming industry.

In conclusion, Fortran, or "Dian Shin Ma Li," stands as a testament to the resilience and creativity of rogue game developers. Its bootleg nature, combined with its gambling-centric gameplay, creates a unique and unforgettable gaming experience. For those fortunate enough to secure a copy, Fortran represents a journey into the hidden corners of gaming history, where the thrill of uncertainty and the allure of the forbidden converge in an 8-bit masterpiece.
